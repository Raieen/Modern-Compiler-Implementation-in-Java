# Modern-Compiler-Implementation-in-Java

I am currently reading [Modern Compiler Implementation in Java](https://www.amazon.ca/Modern-Compiler-Implementation-Andrew-Appel/dp/052182060X) in my free time.

This repo contains my notes and solutions to exercises.

**Note** I will ocassionally write üè´CSCXXX (where CSCXXX is a course code) and some comments if a specific topic is something I have seen previously in class. Eg. Chapter 2.3 & 2.4
